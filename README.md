Micro-JS-Equals
===============

This is a very small, fully-functional JavaScript global .equals() implementation. It can be used in every way a language's .equals() method should be usable. To use this, simply place it at the earliest possible point in your application and let it run. It will add a .equals() method to every existing and future JavaScript object.
